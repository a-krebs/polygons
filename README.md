# Triangulating Polygons

Solver for the following problem:

Draw a polygon of any number of sides. Place a colored dot at each of the corners,
and then place any numver of dots at random on the inside. Then, using the dots
as corners, divide the polygon into non-overlapping trianges and label their
corners using three colors, red blue and yellow.

A triangle having all three colors at its vertices is a complete triangle.

In the example `example.jpg`, the border dots are already colored. Is it possible
to create two complete triangles and no more?
